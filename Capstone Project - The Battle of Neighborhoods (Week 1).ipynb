    "New York City is one of the most densely populated areas in World. It is also quite diverse and probably one of the meccas for great food and wine. This brings a lot of competition as many successfully and renowned chefs and sommeliers come to New York City as the opportunities are great. This makes it hard to make it if you are just starting out in that industry. The competition is fierce and it is hard to figure out where open up a restaurant or wine bar in any of the neighborhoods in New York City. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to use Foursquare location data and regional clustering of venue information to determine what might be the ‘best’ neighbourhood in New York City to open a wine bar. Wine bars becoming very popular in New York City, especially in the very hip neighborhoods like Brooklyn. There are numerous opportunities to open a wine bar but location is a very big factor that determines one's success or failure. Through this project, we will find the most suitable location for an entrepreneur to open a new wine bar in New York City."
